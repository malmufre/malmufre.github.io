## Steps required

There are only three simple steps, so using **Beautiful Jekyll** is *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :smile:)   

Scroll down to see the steps involved,but here is a 40-second video just as a reference as you  work through the steps.If you don't already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join), you'll need to sign up.

### 2. Rename the repository to `yourusername.github.io`

Click on Settings at the top (the cog icon) and on that page you'll have an option to rename the project (Repository name). This will create a website with the Beautiful Jekyll template that will be available at 'https://yourusername.github.io' within a couple minutes  (check out the [FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#custom-domain) if you want to use a different project name). If after a few minutes your website is still not ready, try making any edit to any file, just to force GitHub to re-build your site.

### 3. Customize settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change any settings you want. To edit the file, click on it to view the file and then click on the pencil icon to edit it (watch the video tutorial above if you're confused).  The settings in the file are self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you understand what each setting does. Any line that begins with a hashtag ('#') is a comment, and the other lines are actual settings.

### 4. Congratulations! You have a website!

After you save your changes to the `_config.yml` file (by clicking on *Commit changes* as the video tutorial shows), your website should be ready in a minute or two at `https://<yourusername>.github.io`. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated in about a minute or so. Your website will be initialized with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages.
